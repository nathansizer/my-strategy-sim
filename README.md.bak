# F1 Strategy Simulator

Simulating the strategy options for a race. For this example, I've taken lap times and tyre information from the broadcast of the 2025 British Grand Prix, so some of the numbers may be a bit off compared to the real data.

## Classes

### Main

The entry point of the simulator, runs simulations using the other classes below.

### Tyre

Defines and models the tyres being used for the race. In our example the C4 is the soft tyre, C3 is the medium tyre and C2 is the hard. I'm using the base offset from the TV broadcast, the medium was estimated to be 0.05-0.15 seconds slower than the soft, and the hard 0.30-0.45 seconds slower than the soft. I'm using the worst case scenario numbers in my simulations.

### Strategy

Defines a specific strategy: the lap numbers of each pit stop and the sequence of tyres for each of the stints.

### Race

Models a race using defined strategies. In our example, the 2025 British GP had 52 laps, and I'm using a base lap time of 92 seconds (1m32s). Again, this isn't using the most accurate data and is mainly some arbitrary figures I've worked out, at the end of the day what matters here is the logic behind the simulations and the "plug and play" aspect of this code.
